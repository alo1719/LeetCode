# Testcase Example:  '"TTFF"\n2'
#
# A teacher is writing a test with n true/false questions, with 'T' denoting
# true and 'F' denoting false. He wants to confuse the students by maximizing
# the number of consecutive questions with the same answer (multiple trues or
# multiple falses in a row).
# 
# You are given a string answerKey, where answerKey[i] is the original answer
# to the i^th question. In addition, you are given an integer k, the maximum
# number of times you may perform the following operation:
# 
# 
# Change the answer key for any question to 'T' or 'F' (i.e., set answerKey[i]
# to 'T' or 'F').
# 
# 
# Return the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after
# performing the operation at most k times.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey =
# "TTTT".
# There are four consecutive 'T's.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey =
# "FFFT".
# Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey =
# "TFFF".
# In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1
# Output: 5
# Explanation: We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey = "TTTTTFTT"
# Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey = "TTFTTTTT". 
# In both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == answerKey.length
# 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
# answerKey[i] is either 'T' or 'F'
# 1 <= k <= n
# 
#

        # change to T
        for right in range(n):
            if answerKey[right] == 'F': acc += 1
            while acc > k:
                if answerKey[left] == 'F': acc -= 1
                left += 1
            ans = max(ans, right-left+1)
        acc = 0
        left = 0
        # change to F
        for right in range(n):
            if answerKey[right] == 'T': acc += 1
            while acc > k:
                if answerKey[left] == 'T': acc -= 1
                left += 1
            ans = max(ans, right-left+1)
        return ans
