#
# Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an
# array of characters s.
#
# You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra
# memory.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
# Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
# Example 2:
# Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
# Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
# s[i] is a printable ascii character.
