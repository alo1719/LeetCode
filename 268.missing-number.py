# Testcase Example:  '[3,0,1]'
#
# Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return
# the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [3,0,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range
# [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in
# nums.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [0,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range
# [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in
# nums.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
# Output: 8
# Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range
# [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in
# nums.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == nums.length
# 1 <= n <= 10^4
# 0 <= nums[i] <= n
# All the numbers of nums are unique.
#
#
#
# Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space
# complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?
