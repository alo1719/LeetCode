#
# You are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n.
# 
# The distinct difference array of nums is an array diff of length n such that
# diff[i] is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix nums[i + 1,
# ..., n - 1] subtracted from the number of distinct elements in the prefix
# nums[0, ..., i].
# 
# Return the distinct difference array of nums.
# 
# Note that nums[i, ..., j] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index i
# and ending at index j inclusive. Particularly, if i > j then nums[i, ..., j]
# denotes an empty subarray.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5]
# Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 4 distinct
# elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 4 = -3.
# For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct
# elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.
# For index i = 2, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct
# elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 3 - 2 = 1.
# For index i = 3, there are 4 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct
# element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 4 - 1 = 3.
# For index i = 4, there are 5 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements
# in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 5 - 0 = 5.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [3,2,3,4,2]
# Output: [-2,-1,0,2,3]
# Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 3 distinct
# elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 3 = -2.
# For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct
# elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.
# For index i = 2, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct
# elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 2 - 2 = 0.
# For index i = 3, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct
# element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 3 - 1 = 2.
# For index i = 4, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements
# in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 3 - 0 = 3.
#

# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= n == nums.length <= 50
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 50

class Solution:
    def distinctDifferenceArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        s = set()
        n = len(nums)
        distinct = [0] * n
        tmp = 0
        ans = []
        for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
            if nums[i] not in s:
                tmp += 1
                s.add(nums[i])
            distinct[i-1] = tmp
        s = set()
        tmp = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] not in s:
                tmp += 1
                s.add(nums[i])
            ans.append(tmp-distinct[i])
        return ans
