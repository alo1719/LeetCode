# Testcase Example:  '[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]'
#
# You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by
# 90 degrees (clockwise).
#
# You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the
# input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the
# rotation.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
# Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
# 1 <= n <= 20
# -1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000
#

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        n = len(matrix)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[i].reverse()
