# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]\n4'
#
# Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return
# the number of possible combinations that add up toÂ target.
# 
# The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit
# integer.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# The possible combination ways are:
# (1, 1, 1, 1)
# (1, 1, 2)
# (1, 2, 1)
# (1, 3)
# (2, 1, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (3, 1)
# Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [9], target = 3
# Output: 0
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 200
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# All the elements of nums are unique.
# 1 <= target <= 1000
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does
# it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to
# allow negative numbers?
#

# TC: O(n*target)  SC: O(target)
class Solution:
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # f[i] = sum(f[i-num]) for num in nums
        @cache
        def f(summ):
            if summ == target: return 1
            if summ > target: return 0
            ans = 0
            for i in range(n):
                ans += f(summ+nums[i])
            return ans
        n = len(nums)
        return f(0)
