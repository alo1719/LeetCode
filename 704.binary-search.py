# Testcase Example:  '[-1,0,3,5,9,12]\n9'
#
# Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an
# integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists,
# then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
# 
# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
# -10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4
# All the integers in nums are unique.
# nums is sorted in ascending order.
#

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        left, right = 0, n-1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left+right)//2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid+1
            else:
                right = mid-1
        return -1
