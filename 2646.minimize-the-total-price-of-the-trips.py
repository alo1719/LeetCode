#
# There exists an undirected and unrooted tree with n nodes indexed from 0 to n
# - 1. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n -
# 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai
# and bi in the tree.
# 
# Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array price,
# where price[i] is the price of the i^th node.
# 
# The price sum of a given path is the sum of the prices of all nodes lying on
# that path.
# 
# Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array trips, where trips[i] =
# [starti, endi] indicates that you start the i^th trip from the node starti
# and travel to the node endi by any path you like.
# 
# Before performing your first trip, you can choose some non-adjacent nodes and
# halve the prices.
# 
# Return the minimum total price sum to perform all the given trips.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]], price = [2,2,10,6], trips =
# [[0,3],[2,1],[2,3]]
# Output: 23
# Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 2.
# The first part shows the initial tree and the second part shows the tree
# after choosing nodes 0, 2, and 3, and making their price half.
# For the 1^st trip, we choose path [0,1,3]. The price sum of that path is 1 +
# 2 + 3 = 6.
# For the 2^nd trip, we choose path [2,1]. The price sum of that path is 2 + 5
# = 7.
# For the 3^rd trip, we choose path [2,1,3]. The price sum of that path is 5 +
# 2 + 3 = 10.
# The total price sum of all trips is 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.
# It can be proven, that 23 is the minimum answer that we can achieve.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], price = [2,2], trips = [[0,0]]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 0.
# The first part shows the initial tree and the second part shows the tree
# after choosing node 0, and making its price half.
# For the 1^st trip, we choose path [0]. The price sum of that path is 1.
# The total price sum of all trips is 1. It can be proven, that 1 is the
# minimum answer that we can achieve.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= n <= 50
# edges.length == n - 1
# 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
# edges represents a valid tree.
# price.length == n
# price[i] is an even integer.
# 1 <= price[i] <= 1000
# 1 <= trips.length <= 100
# 0 <= starti, endiÂ <= n - 1
