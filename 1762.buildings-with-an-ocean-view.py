# There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

# The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

# Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

#  

# Example 1:

# Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
# Output: [0,2,3]
# Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
# Example 2:

# Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
# Output: [0,1,2,3]
# Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
# Example 3:

# Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
# Output: [3]
# Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.
#  

# Constraints:

# 1 <= heights.length <= 10**5
# 1 <= heights[i] <= 10**9
